## What is this organization?

This organization will serve as a place to organize all of the boilerplate code that I've setup as [template repositories](https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/). I didn't want to litter my regular profile with a bunch of template repositories as I wanted it to have active projects on there. I tried setting up a single boilerplate repo that simply had branches , that's when I read about [Github Organization's for grouping](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20908994/grouping-repos-on-github) related repo's and now here we are.

## Current Planned Template Setups:

1. frontend-static-seo-site
  - Setup something that would allow you to do custom html as you want but have partials, etc.

2. frontend-plain-spa-app
3. frontend-react-app

## Technological Choices and Aspects

This is a list of all the different technological goals I'm looking to achieve within these repositories. Not every goal will be covered in every repository, each repository will be made up of a selection of the technologies that help achieve that repositories goals.

  - Bundlers: Webpack vs Rollup vs Parcel vs MicroBundle
  - VS Code config file for styling setup
  - Github issues template files with just basic Markdown

## Interests

Interesting tools that I've run into that I'm not sure where they fit into my workflow but I'd like to keep them on my radar.

1. [Loopback, a tool for api developers, kind of like a boilerplate generator itself](https://loopback.io/)
2. [Tailwind CSS, utility first css framework](https://tailwindcss.com/)
