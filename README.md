## What is this organization?

This organization will serve as a place to organize all of the boilerplate code that I've setup as [template repositories](https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/). I didn't want to litter my regular profile with a bunch of template repositories as I wanted it to have active projects on there. I tried setting up a single boilerplate repo that simply had branches , that's when I read about [Github Organization's for grouping](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20908994/grouping-repos-on-github) related repo's and now here we are.

## Current Planned Template Setups:

1. frontend-static-seo-site
2. frontend-plain-spa-app
3. frontend-react-app
4. php-plain-bootstrap

## Interesting Tools I'd like to look into:
1. [Loopback, a tool for api developers, kind of like a boilerplate generator itself](https://loopback.io/)
